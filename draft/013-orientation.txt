ORIENTATION

..

We have a working (mostly) project, log and roadmap widget with basic
functionality and some things needing same cleanup.

..

Next step: following the previous feature push, some cleanup and testing is due.
This involves

    * adressing the inconsistencies
    * reviewing the code
    * testing the application
    * bugfixes

After that's done it's time for a new tag and push further with the features:

    * save / open documents
    * save / load configuration
    * exit handler

Tag here

    * mistctrl
    * mistnavi

Tag here

    * cleanup, bugfix, test, review, package

Tag here

    * release
