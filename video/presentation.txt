Hi. Nelia1 is an application to track features and issues in milestones. It's
written with a single user in mind and focuses on providing a good overview for
current and future personal development projects.

-- blend in Nelia1 window --

The main window shows a listing of projects in the currently open document. This
list gives a quick view of the project names, types, category, priority,
challenge and active version. The active version contains the version number and
the open and total number of features and issues.

On the log tab you can keep a diary for the selected application. It's
straight forward. You set the title and the log message.  Notice how the
currently selected project is displayed in the top line and title. This log
list belongs to this project only.

Most of the magic happens on the roadmap tab. This keep track of the features
and issues of your project. You assign them to milestones and then close them
one-by-one. Then move on to the next milestone.

The application was designed with the aim to reduce your congnitive overhead.
You can simply switch between your projects, retrive the information you need
