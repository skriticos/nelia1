Hello. In this video I'll introduce the Linux desktop application Nelia1.
It's a personal project tracking tool. When I say personal, I mean small and
seed projects that only you work on. Think about all the awesome ideas that
you have during coding, but have a different focus at the time. With Nelia1
you can quickly capture them then proceed with whatever you code and follow
up later. Also, your set of utility libraries and tools that you generally
use, with Nelia1 you can easily keep track of them.

This is how the application looks when you start it up.
*** controls ***
*** project list ***
*** project description ***

I'll create two quick sample project entries for demonstration.

-- open the new project dialog --

*** name ***
*** project attributes ***
*** general description ***

-- submit project --

*** new entry ***
*** layout ***
*** auto fields (version, modification, creation) ***
*** filtering -> modification date ***

-- create second sample --

*** description update ***

-- switch to log tab --

On the log tab you can keep a diary for the selected application. It's
straight forward. You set the title and the log message.  Notice how the
currently selected project is displayed in the top line and title. This log
list belongs to this project only.

*** create startup log ***

-- switch to project tab, select other project, swith back to log tab --

*** create second log ***

-- switch back to other project --
-- switch to the roadmap tab --

Most of the magic happens on the roadmap tab. This keep track of the features
and issues of your project. You assign them to milestones and then close them
one-by-one. Then move on to the next milestone.

*** control section ***
*** milestone description ***
*** milestone item list ***
*** milestone item description ***

*** create milestone items ***
*** name, attributes, description ***

*** close milestone items ***
*** demonstrate filters ***

-- move around the roadmap --

*** milestone selection button ***
*** empty diomond, partially filled diamond, filled diamond ***

-- blend back the logo --

The application was designed with the aim to reduce your congnitive overhead.
You can simply switch between your projects, retrive the information you need
and track the progress.
